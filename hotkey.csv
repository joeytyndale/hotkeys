Thank you for contacting LinkedIn Learning.

I'm very sorry for the inconvenience this is causing.

This course is an ongoing course which continually has new content added to it. Because of this format it's not possible to ""Complete"" the course and it likewise doesn't issue a certificate. 

You can identify this type of course by going to the ""Overview"" tab and looking for this note:

""Note: Because this is an ongoing series, viewers will not receive a certificate of completion.""
